#how to connect yourself as new user
for ssh, run "ssh username@ip_address" and enter your password.
for the graphic session, first make sure you're allowed X11 forwarding 
	by checking /etc/ssh/sshd_config; add these lines if need be:
	X11Forwarding yes
	X11DisplayOffset 10
	and if you had to edit file, run "sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart".
	then, run "ssh -X username@ip_address".
